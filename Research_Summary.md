Research Summary: KG-CAE (Knowledge-Grounded Contrastive Autoencoder)
===============================================================

Purpose
-------

This document summarizes the research aims, model components, theoretical framing, hypotheses, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics from `Research_Model_Ideas.md`. It is intended as a single-page index and outline for collaborators and reviewers.

Contents (outline)
------------------

1. Conceptual overview and motivation
   - Bridge continuous embeddings with symbolic knowledge (URIs)
   - Reduce LLM hallucination via knowledge-grounded prototypes
   - Use graph-derived hard negatives for factual learning

2. High-level model intuitions
   - Dual outputs (URI + embedding) provide complementary capabilities
   - Joint training aligns embedding geometry with symbolic classes
   - Hard negatives (entity swaps) expose factual signals

3. Novel components (short descriptions)
   - KACR: Knowledge-Aware Contrastive Regularizer that pulls k-hop neighbors closer
   - UCLR: URI-Conditioned Latent Reshaping using soft-projections onto prototype subspaces
   - DNH: Dynamic Negative Hardening curriculum (random -> graph-swap -> latent-nearest)
   - MHSC: Multi-Hop Semantic Consistency that enforces radial hop ordering in embedding space

4. Theoretical framing and hypotheses
   - Definitions and notation: encoder f_θ, classifier g_φ, prototypes p_u, graph hop h_G
   - H1 (Geometry-as-Factuality): embedding distances correlate monotonically with hop distance
   - H2 (Prototype Separability): prototypes are domain-separated by margin τ_sep
   - H3 (Calibration-Geometry Consistency): classifier confidence correlates with distance to prototype
   - H4 (Tightness vs Recall): tighter prototypes increase precision but can reduce recall

5. Operationalization and metrics
   - Prototype estimation (EMA or held-out samples)
   - Hop-based statistics: μ_h = E_{pairs at hop h}[ d ] and Spearman ρ tests
   - Embedding-factuality AUC, prototype separation stats, calibration metrics (ECE, Brier), downstream metrics (MRR, nDCG)

6. Ablations and experiments
   - Baselines: contrastive-only, classification-only, combined
   - Component ablations: KACR, UCLR, DNH, MHSC
   - Evaluation axes: entity linking, embedding factuality, retrieval, robustness

7. Interpretability directions
   - Prototype visualizations, attention attribution, counterfactual edits

8. Failure modes and mitigations
   - Over-clustering, surface-cue shortcuts, calibration drift, KG noise

9. Practical recommendations
   - EMA prototypes (momentum ~0.99); recompute offline for final eval
   - Tune regularizer weights (λ_kacr, λ_mhsc) on ambiguous validation sets
   - Maintain per-prototype support sizes and reporting standards

10. Reproducibility & release items
   - Release datasets splits, prototype data, evaluation scripts, plots (distance-vs-hop, reliability diagrams)
