I can add small runnable helper scripts:
hop_precompute.py to compute hop distances from a KG (SPARQL or local dump).
prototype_analysis.py to export eval_embeddings.pkl, compute prototypes, Î¼_h, plots, ECE, and prototype stats (this can be runnable with minimal dependencies).
calibration_analysis.py to compute reliability diagrams and temperature scaling.
I can add compact PyTorch loss snippets and unit tests that integrate with your training loop (need to see the model/trainer code or provide a small adapter).
I can convert the example Python snippet into a CLI script with arguments and simple logging (and add a small requirements.txt).
I can produce high-quality figures (SVG/PNG) from the Mermaid diagram or convert diagrams into matplotlib examples (I can add prebuilt plots or code to generate them).
